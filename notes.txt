# Questions about images
- Is the noise level always proportional to total energy?
- Is the detector always hit in a single pixel with some bleed?

Observations for paper:
-The image artifacts appear when using uniform grid for training a model!!!!! (ie is not the fault of

# current problem: no random subpixel placement, makes model learn pixels



TODO:
Compare difference for simulated PSF spread!
-Create superresolution solution (using virtual hits)


optimize data generation (especially for gyroadapted, super slow atm)
generate entire image bach at the same time?
Move trained networks to shared location (where?)
