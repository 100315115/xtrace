# xtrace repo usage

Note this is a mirrored repo hosted both on GitHub and Gitlab.

Upstream repository: https://gitlab.com/MAXIV-SCISW/projects/xtrace
Downstream repository: https://github.com/maxiv-science/xtrace

## Usage guidelines

- All commits should be pushed into the upstream repo.
- Note that GitLab is using force push from the upstream to the downstream, so any changes downstream will be overwritten and lost.
- If you cannot push in the upstream repo, new branches can be created downstream. However to avoid conflicts and data loss, please send a msg to maintainers of the upstream repo asap.
