TODO:
-Clean up code, collect under v2? (library + example folder)
-Try different deconvolution methods and compare them
-Try on synthetic data: deconvolution with PSFs created with different ray positions, can artefacts be reconstructed in a synthetic example (ie can we figure out what part is responsible for creating the artifacts, is it PSF construction, deconv, noise, something else?)

Thoughts ML method:
-Difficulty of teaching a neural network: needs poni info? (or can figure this out automatically maybe?)
-Generate synthetic data by creating PSFs with rays specifically located at certain positions, can we then just get positions of all detector hits instead? (What features are we actually interested in???)
